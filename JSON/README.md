<h1>Working with JSON - quick play</h1>

<h2>Task</h2>
<p>Rather than using Javascript,use PHP to take a JSON rugby feed and display results.  Limit: 1 hour.</p>

<h2>Files:</h2>
<p>index.php</p>
<p>template.php</p>
<p>class.feed.php</p>


<h2>Notes:</h2>
<p>Numerous ways to tackle this but ultimately I went for one that was quick and relatively easy to modify.  I steared away from a completely OOP solution, instead opting to convert the json into an array.</p>
<p>I've chosen to keep the page template completely separate as in a fully fledged system (MCV) it would make it much easier to maintain and the fixtures feeds could in fact be applied to other/multiple pages.</p>
<p>I started to add in html tags and styling into the output but had worked on it for nearly an hour by this point.</p>
